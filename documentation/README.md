# Model documentation


## Overview

There are two base models:
- The `1 region` model has only one region, in which demand (generated by a mixture of baseload, peaking and wind technologies) must match supply, allowing unmet demand at high cost.
- The `6 region` model has six regions. Electricity may be generated and transmitted across the regions according to a transmission topology, taken from the *IEEE 6-bus test system*.

For each of the two base models, there are 4 customisable inputs/settings that change the model's behaviour. They are:
- `ts_data`: the time series 
- `run_mode`: The models may be run in two modes:
  - `plan`: generation and transmission capacities are determined by minimising system (sum of installation and generation) costs.
  - `operate`: generation and transmission capacities are fixed and the system is operated to match supply and demand at minimum cost.
- `baseload_integer`:
  - `False`: baseload may be built to any nonnegative capacity (i.e. a continuous variable).
  - `True`: baseload may be built only in blocks of 3GW, which makes a model in `plan` mode a mixed-integer linear program and slower to solve.
  This switch matters only in `plan` mode, since in `operate` mode the capacities are user-defined.o
- `baseload_ramping`:
  - `False`: baseload generation can change at any rate
  - `True`: baseload generation can only ramp up or down at 20% of its installed capacity per hour


## Generation & transmission technologies

### Generation technologies

| Technology | Installation cost <br> (£m/GWyr) | Generation cost <br> (£m/GWh) | Carbon Emissions <br> (t CO2/GWh) |
| -- | -- | -- | -- |
| Baseload     | 300 | 0.005 | 200 |
| Peaking      | 100 | 0.035 | 400 |
| Wind         | 100 |     0 |   0 |
| Unmet demand |   0 |     6 |   0 |

### Transmission technologies (in `6 region` model)

| Regions | Installation cost <br> (£m/GWyr) |
| -- | -- |
| Region 1 to 5 | 150 |
| Other         | 100 |
