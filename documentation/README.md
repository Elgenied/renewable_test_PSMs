# Model documentation


There are two base models:
- The `1 region` model has only one region, in which demand (generated by a mixture of baseload, peaking and wind technologies) must match supply, allowing unmet demand at high cost.
- The `6 region` model has six regions. Electricity may be generated and transmitted across the regions according to a transmission topology, taken from the *IEEE 6-bus test system*.

For each of the two base models, there are 4 customisable inputs/settings that change the model's behaviour. They are:
- `ts_data`: the time series 
- `run_mode`: The models may be run in two modes:
  - `plan`: generation and transmission capacities are determined by minimising system (sum of installation and generation) costs.
  - `operate`: generation and transmission capacities are fixed and the system is operated to match supply and demand at minimum cost.
