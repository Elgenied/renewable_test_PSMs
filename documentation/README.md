# Model documentation


## Overview

This repository seeks to provide simple test cases and sample code for renewable energy and time series analysis. For this reason, the models are simple, but have all the features of full-scale models. The code has been written to make the models as accessible and quick-to-use as possible. Running a model is as simple as modifying `main.py` with different values for the following entries in the `run_dict`:

- `model_name`:
  - `1_region`: one region, in which supply (generated by a mixture of technologies) must match demand.
  - `6_region`: six regions, where electricity can be transmitted across the grid according to a transmission topology (inspired by the *IEEE 6-bus test system*).
- `ts_data`: the demand and wind time series data to use in the model.
- `run_mode`:
  - `plan`: generation and transmission capacities are determined by minimising system (sum of installation and generation) costs.
  - `operate`: generation and transmission capacities are fixed and the system is operated to match supply and demand at minimum cost.
- `baseload_integer`
  - `False`: baseload may be built to any nonnegative capacity (i.e. a continuous variable).
  - `True`: baseload may be built only in blocks of 3GW, which makes a model in `plan` mode a mixed-integer linear program and slower to solve. This switch matters only in `plan` mode, since in `operate` mode the capacities are user-defined.
- `baseload_ramping`:
  - `False`: baseload generation can change at any rate
  - `True`: baseload generation can only ramp up or down at 20% of its installed capacity per hour

The models may be customised further by editing the model-defining files:
- Costs associted with each generation & transmission technologies: change in `models/{MODEL_NAME}/techs.yaml`.
- Fixed generation and transmission capacities used in `operate` mode: change in `models/{MODEL_NAME}/model.yaml`.


## Generation & transmission technologies

### Generation technologies

| Technology | Installation cost <br> (£m/GWyr) | Generation cost <br> (£m/GWh) | Carbon Emissions <br> (t CO2/GWh) |
| -- | -- | -- | -- |
| Baseload     | 300 | 0.005 | 200 |
| Peaking      | 100 | 0.035 | 400 |
| Wind         | 100 |     0 |   0 |
| Unmet demand |   0 |     6 |   0 |

### Transmission technologies (in `6 region` model)

| Regions | Installation cost <br> (£m/GWyr) |
| -- | -- |
| Region 1 to 5 | 150 |
| Other         | 100 |




| Bus | Demand / candidate generation |
| ---:| ----------------------------- | 
| 1   | baseload, peaking             |
| 2   | demand (DE), wind (DE)        |
| 3   | baseload, peaking             |
| 4   | demand (FR)                   |
| 5   | demand (UK), wind (UK)        |
| 6   | baseload, peaking, wind (ES)  |
